""" Design a Python class named `BankAccount` to represent bank accounts. 
    Theory: A bank account typically includes attributes such as account number, balance, and account holder name. The class should handle operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and transfer of funds between accounts. Operations: 
        1. Deposit: Add funds to the account 
        2. Withdrawal: Subtract funds from the account 
        3. Transfer: Transfer funds from one account to another 
        
        Test Cases: 
            Test Case 1: acc1 = BankAccount("John Doe", 1000) acc2 = BankAccount("Jane Smith", 2000) assert acc1.balance == 1000 assert acc2.balance == 2000 acc1.deposit(500) acc2.withdraw(100) acc1.transfer(acc2, 200) assert acc1.balance == 1300 assert acc2.balance == 2300 
            Test Case 2: acc3 = BankAccount("Alice Johnson", 500) acc4 = BankAccount("Bob Brown", 1500) assert acc3.balance == 500 assert acc4.balance == 1500 acc3.deposit(100) acc4.withdraw(200) acc3.transfer(acc4, 300) assert acc3.balance == 400 assert acc4.balance == 1800 """
